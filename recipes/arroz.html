  <h2>Know your Rice</h2>
  <p> There are three basic kinds of rice: short-grain, long-grain, and medium-grain. Among them you'll find hundreds of different varieties.

Short-grain rice is rounded and plump, with a high starch content that makes the grains stick together when cooked, especially if the rice has been milled to make white rice.

Long-grain rice is much longer than it is wide. Its lower starch content makes the cooked grains lighter, dryer, and more easily separated.

Medium-grain rice slots right between short- and long-grain rice both in shape and starchiness.

  <h2>How to Cook</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>To wash away excess starch, measure rice into a pot and pour in enough cold water to cover the grains. Gently swish the rice with your fingers and rub lightly. Pour out the starchy water (you can pour through a sieve so you don't lose any grains). Repeat one or two times, depending on how starchy the rice is. The water does not have to be completely clear after the final wash. </li>
    <li>After pouring out the water for the last time, add clean water to the pot (add 1Â½ to 2 cups of water for 1 cup rice). </li>    
    <li>Cover the pot and bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to its lowest setting. Let the rice gently simmer for 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let the rice continue to steam in the covered pot for five minutes.</li>
